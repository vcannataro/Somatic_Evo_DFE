R code associated with The Implications of Small Stem Cell Niche Sizes and the Distribution of Fitness Effects of New Mutations in Aging and Tumorigenesis

Hello world. These files were used to generate the analysis and figures in the mentioned manuscript.
I learned coding and R while working on this project. Any feedback is appreciated. 

The "master" file sources the various other files, and the polyp.csv data is from Chapman, I. (1963). Adenomatous polypi of large intestine: incidence and distribution. Annals of Surgery, 157, 223â€“6.
You need to save them all to the same directory.
